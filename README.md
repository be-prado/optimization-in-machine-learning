# optimization-in-machine-learning
This repository has code to solve a variety of machine learning problems using efficient and scalable optimization methods. The problems solved include logistic regression, robust principal component analysis, matrix completion, dictionary learning and orthogonal dictionary learning. The algorithms were written as homework assignments for a Optimization in Machine Learning course at the University of Michigan.
